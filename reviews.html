										<strong>5.0 out of 5 stars</strong> Fantastic, couldn't put it down <br>
										Very rich tapestry woven masterfully into a world of fantasy and science fiction. This story draws from combined styles of some of my favorite authors, hints of the gunfighter series of Steven King, Shannara trilogy by Terry Brooks and even Louis Lamoure. I feel that the story will appeal to a wide audience through the stories engaging character's love story, the fight of a culture to survive and an intergalactic battle

										<strong>5.0 out of 5 stars</strong> This was recommended to me through Goodreads and is so NOT my normal genre's but I was very pleasantly surprised. Very nicely laid out story, kept me engrossed and had enough of my romantic elements to make me LOVE this book. Author did a really good job with elements I didn't expect to like. Awesome!

									<strong>5.0 out of 5 stars</strong> Such a wonderful book! It has such a great blend <br>
									<em>By Victoria
									<br>Format:Kindle Edition</em><br>
									Such a wonderful book! It has such a great blend. It's sci-fi, it's adventure, it has the touch of the mystical and has a touch of military strategy, or just the strategy to outwit an enemy, or get a person back into wanting to live again (love the relationship of the "dad like" Captain that get's Roy back out into wanting to live in the world again after he experiences tragedy. And it is a beautiful love story as well, with an almost "brigadoon" ethereal quality. This has such a interwoven complexity and robustness, it immerses you immediately and to the end. Can't wait till the sequel.

										<strong>4.0 out of 5 stars</strong>  As I was reading through the book I found myself liking it more and more.<br>
										<em>By Stephanie <br>
										Format:Kindle Edition|Verified Purchase</em><br>
										The Warrior's Stone: The New Terra Sagas: Book One, by Matthew O. Duncan, starts right off by introducing the character of Lt. Commander Roy O'Hara as he leads his squadron into battle. The objective: destroy the enemy's latest Super Destroyer. Things go downhill for Roy when he is shot down and crash lands on an unexplored planet. Near death he is soon found by a young woman named Katreena. She saves his life by using a special stone called the Boto Stone. She is unware <br>that by using the stone she has created an intimate bond between them.
										<br>At first I wasn't so sure that I was going to like this book. However, as I was reading through the book I found myself liking it more and more. The ending has definitely got me wanting to read the next book in the series. The storyline is interesting, nicely written, and well thought out. The characters are nicely written and the growing relationship between Roy and Katreena is believable. I recommend those who like the Sci-fi/Fantasy/Romance genres to try out this book.
